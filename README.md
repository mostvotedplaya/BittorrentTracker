Bittorrent Tracker
=================

This is my implementation of a Open torrent tracker in PHP, the reason for me creating this is because i strongly believe
there isn't a great deal of good trackers out there that follow a up to date specification so my objective is to create exactly that whilst ensuring the quality of code is optimized as much as possible due to running a tracker can be quite heavy
when we are talking about dealing with 100,000 peers +

This implementation will be heavily based on everything discussed in this link:

https://wiki.theory.org/BitTorrentSpecification

<b>Requirements</b>
PHP 5.4 + with PDO
MySQL
Webserver 

<b>Apache</b>

For users whom use apache i have supplied a .htaccess which will provide nice urls providing mod_rewrite is enabled, forexample:
