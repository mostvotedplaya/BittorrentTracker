Bittorrent Tracker - (INCOMPLETE)
=================

This is my implementation of a Open torrent tracker in PHP, the reason for me creating this is because i strongly believe
there isn't a great deal of good trackers out there that follow a up to date specification so my objective is to create exactly that whilst ensuring the quality of code is optimized as much as possible due to running a tracker can be quite heavy
when we are talking about dealing with 100,000 peers +

This implementation will be heavily based on everything discussed in this link:

https://wiki.theory.org/BitTorrentSpecification

<b>Requirements</b>

PHP 5.4 + with PDO

MySQL

Webserver 

<b>Apache</b>

For users whom use apache i have supplied a .htaccess which will provide nice urls providing mod_rewrite is enabled, forexample:

http://domain.tld/announce

http://domain.tld/scrape

<b>Scrape</b>

If no info hash is specified then all available torrents in the database are returned providing they have not been
set as banned.

Multiple scrape requests are supported.

Scraping supports the following dictionaries / keys.
 
 + files
   + infohash
     - complete
     - incomplete
     - downloaded
     - name
 - failure reason
 + flags
     - min_request_interval
    
<b>Failure reason</b> 

will be available if no results are found.

<b>Announce</b>

Failure reasons:

 #1 - One or more fields were missing from the request.
 
 #2 - The info_hash was not the correct length.
 
 #3 - The peer_id was not the correct length.
 
 #4 - A invalid port was provided.
 
 #5 - The torrent is not registered at the tracker.
 
 #6 - The torrent is banned.
  
<b>Installation</b>

1.) Upload files inside upload folder to your webserver.

2.) Create database.

3.) Import SQL.

4.) Update backend/config.php with your SQL settings.
